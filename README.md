Domain Specific Languages for Internet of Things APIs
=====================================================

This is a JetBrains MPS project. To use it, 
* get MPS 2017.2 from http://jetbrains.com/mps
* clone this project
* open in MPS
* build Platform solution
* build IoT_API language
* build C_Syntax language
* build JNI_C_Generator language
* build C_Lib_Generator language
* build JNI_Java_Generator language
* build Latex language
* build XML_Generator language
* build de.kontext_e.xml language
* build the solutions C_Lib, JNI_C, and JNI_Java

Note: for a real project, the usage of C_Syntax is discouraged. Use
a real C language instead, e.g. mbeddr.

There is an example for a Game of Life API. The generated code is used in
https://github.com/kontext-e/IoT_C and
https://github.com/kontext-e/IoT_Java
